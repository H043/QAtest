<h2>Gianluigi Buffon
	</h2>

	<p>Hi, my name is Gianluigi Buffon, but everybody can call me just Buffon. <p>Let me tell you about myself a little.</p>
	<p>I am 3 year old boy, Beagle breed.</p>
	<p>I was born in sunny Crimea region in Ukraine. Later i moved to another beautiful sunny place, named Odessa. And there i met my family.</p>
	<p>As any other beagle, i am super active, curious, cute and funny.
		I love to walk and run outside, especcialy on the coast. I can run and follow seaguls and try to catch them.
	Of course, i love to eat and sleep as well :)</p>
	<p>Normally i am eating regular dog food, but i am always trying to still some deliccius piece from the family table.
	After long run i like to find some comfortable place, such as big soft bed and have a good nap. </p>
	<p>I am living a happy life, my family loves me, and i love them.
	you can check some of pictures in the gallery and my IG of course.</p>
