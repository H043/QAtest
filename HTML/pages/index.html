	<p class="p_main">Hi, my name is Gianluigi Buffon, but everybody can call me just Buffon. 
	<p class="p_main">Let me tell you a little about myself</p>
	<p class="p_main">I am a 3 year old boy of the Beagle breed.</p>
	<p class="p_main">I was born in the sunny Crimea region of Ukraine. Later, I moved to another beautiful, sunny place, named Odessa. And there, I met my family.</p>
	<p class="p_main">As any other beagle, I am super active, curious, cute, and funny. I love to walk and run outside, especially on the coast. I can run and follow seagulls and try to catch them. Of course, I love to eat and sleep as well.</p>
	<p class="p_main">Normally, I eat regular dog food, but I am always trying to get some delicacies from the family table. After a long run, I like to find some comfortable place, such as a big soft bed, and have a good nap. </p>
	<p class="p_main">II am living a happy life; my family loves me, and I love them. You can check out some pictures in the gallery and my Instagram, of course.</p>
